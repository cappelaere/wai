# Manual Reviews of Schaolarship Applications

## 1. What “manual and fair” actually means

For **400 applications** with **2,000–4,000 files**, a *fair* manual review usually implies:

* Every complete application is:

  * Read end-to-end at least once.
  * Scored against clear criteria.
  * Given written notes or justification.
* The top subset (say top 10–20) are:

  * Re-read.
  * Compared side-by-side.
  * Discussed in a live meeting.

That’s not “skim the first paragraph and circle a number.” That’s real due diligence for a **$10,000 award**.

## 2. Time per application (realistic, not optimistic)

For one reviewer, being reasonably thorough:

* **Essay(s)** – read + reflect: 8–12 minutes
* **Resume** – scan for education, experience, activities: 3–5 minutes
* **Recommendation letters (1–3)** – read + interpret: 10–15 minutes
* **Other docs** (medical, logbooks, extras) – at least a skim: 5 minutes
* **Scoring + notes** – choosing scores, writing justification: 5 minutes

Conservative fair-review estimate:

> ~30 minutes per application
> (And honestly, 40–45 minutes wouldn’t be crazy for complex packages.)

Let’s stick with **30 minutes** just to be kind.

## 3. Total time for one reviewer

* **400 applications × 30 minutes**
  = 12,000 minutes
  = 200 hours

At a full 8-hour “reading day” (which is already exhausting):

* **200 hours ÷ 8 hours/day ≈ 25 full days** of focused review
  → **5 weeks** of full-time work for *one person*.

And that’s without re-reading the finalists, without meetings, and without breaks for being a human.

## 4. But it’s a *board*, not a single reviewer

Now imagine a **review board of 5 people** trying to be fair:

Two common patterns:

### Pattern A – Every reviewer reads everything

(“We all see every candidate, so the decision feels fair.”)

* Each reviewer → ~200 hours
* Across 5 reviewers → **1,000 person-hours**

Even if they only manage 3 hours of *high-quality* reading per day (very realistic), that’s:

* 200 hours ÷ 3 hours/day ≈ 67 working days per reviewer
* That’s **more than 3 months** of part-time, intense reading.

### Pattern B – Split the pool, then cross-check the finalists

* Each reviewer reads ~80 applications (400 ÷ 5).
* 80 apps × 30 minutes = 2,400 minutes = 40 hours each
  → 1 full week per reviewer for first pass.
* Then:

  * The top 20–30 finalists are re-read by multiple reviewers:

    * say 25 finalists × 30 minutes × 3 reviewers
      = 2,250 minutes ≈ 37.5 hours more.

So even with a very pragmatic split-and-merge process, you’re looking at:

> **~70–80 hours per reviewer**
> → 2+ weeks of serious effort, for each board member.

And all of this assumes:

* No time lost hunting for the right file in the wrong folder.
* No time re-opening the same essay because you forgot what you read.
* No disputes about “what this recommender actually said” because it’s buried in a PDF.

## 5. The punchline

So, framed in plain language for the review board:

> To manually and fairly review 400 applications with 2,000–4,000 files for a $10,000 scholarship, you’re realistically looking at **hundreds of person-hours**:
>
> * Around **200 hours** if one person tried to do it all (5 weeks full time).
> * Around **70–80 hours per person** for a 5-member board with a split-and-finalist approach.
> * **1,000+ total person-hours** if everyone reads everything.

That’s the real cost of “doing it right” without help.

And that’s exactly the gap the profile-and-agent system is meant to close:

* Not by cutting corners on fairness,
* But by cutting the *wasted time* digging through files so the board’s time is spent where it matters:
  **comparing the best candidates, not hunting for page 3 of a recommendation letter.**
