# Scholarship Reviewer

The Women In Aviation International (WAI) manages scholarships for yound ladies wanting to fly fixed wings, helicopters or even drones.
For each scholarship, many applicants respond.
As a reviewer, the goal is to rank the applications for a specific scholarship based on user defined criteria.  The applications are then sorted by rank and a report is generated for the top ranked applications.  This allows the actual review committee to focus on the best applications, use the summary information provided by the system and determine the winner for the scholarhip.

The data is organized in folders.  Each scholarship has its own folder.
An scholarship folder contains:  
- a worksheet with application profile data
- a folder with all the application folders

An application folder is named after the WAI membership number of the applicant.
This folder contains a list of files (.pdf, .docx, .jpeg, .jpg, .png)
the last file in that folder is the application form document. the naming convention for that file is _<|application_number|-|number|>.pdf
Every other file in that folder appends an attachment number and the proper file type.
