# **WAI Co-Pilot – The Vision **

Every year, as the leaves settle and the holidays begin, the Women in Aviation International website lights up with possibility. Hundreds of scholarships open at once. Hundreds of donors, each with their own mission and criteria, begin their countdown to selecting the next rising star. And hundreds of review boards brace themselves for the season they know is coming.

It always happens between Thanksgiving and Christmas.
Always when life is the busiest.
Always when time is stretched thin between work deadlines, family travel, and the gentle pressure of the year’s end.

Yet this is precisely when the most important decisions must be made.

Each scholarship brings its own values. Some seek leadership. Others academic excellence. Some want to uplift those who serve their communities. Others want to see passion in an essay, potential in a logbook, discipline in a medical certificate, or a spark of professionalism in someone’s digital presence. Donors define what matters most, and review boards try to honor that. But the diversity of criteria, the sheer number of applications, and the unforgiving calendar create a perfect storm.

Imagine a single scholarship receiving four hundred applications. That means two to four thousand separate documents — essays and resumes, recommendation letters and medical scans, logbooks and portfolios — all piling up inside folders named like serial numbers. Now multiply that by hundreds of scholarships. The mountain becomes overwhelming, not because reviewers lack dedication, but because no one has the hours it takes to climb it fairly.

What does fairness even look like when December steals so much attention?

This is the part of the story where frustration quietly becomes risk. Not the risk of bad candidates slipping through, but of brilliant ones disappearing under the weight of too many PDFs, too many criteria, and too little time. Reviewers want to honor every applicant, but holiday reality has other plans. Fatigue creeps in, stories blur, and the difference between a six and an eight depends on how long the day has already been.

Now imagine something different.

Imagine the WAI website not as a vault of documents but as a cockpit, where every reviewer has a co-pilot sitting beside them. A co-pilot who has already read every single application for that scholarship. A co-pilot who understands that this scholarship values leadership while the one next to it prioritizes academic excellence, and the one after that seeks community service or early flight experience. A co-pilot who knows the rubric for each scholarship intimately and can adapt instantly to the donor’s intent.

Reviewers wouldn’t scroll through folders anymore.
They would have conversations.

“Show me the applicants who match this scholarship’s criteria best.”
“Explain which ones truly shine in the personal story dimension.”
“Help me narrow four hundred applicants down to the top five I should bring to the board meeting.”
“What did the recommendation letters reveal about her?”
“Why is she ranked number three instead of number seven?”
“Who best matches the spirit of this award?”

The co-pilot answers every question, day or night, from a phone or laptop, over text or voice. It has patience when reviewers don’t. It remembers details they can’t. It lifts the strongest candidates to the surface so that the board’s time is spent discussing potential, not files.

And when the review board finally meets — sometimes in person, sometimes on Zoom, sometimes around a living room table with a glass of wine — everyone arrives confident, prepared, and already aligned. The conversation becomes joyful again, because the hard part has been transformed. Instead of drowning in December documents, the board is celebrating the finalists. Instead of hunting for a logbook page, they’re debating who has earned next year’s scholarship. Instead of worrying about fairness, they trust it implicitly because every ranking, every summary, every insight is transparent, explainable, and grounded in evidence.

This is what happens when WAI has a Co-Pilot.

And this is why IBM is the right partner for this moment. Not because we build sophisticated AI systems, but because we build responsible ones — the kind that can understand different criteria, apply them consistently, and make their reasoning visible. The kind designed not to replace reviewers, but to protect their judgment. The kind that helps people make better decisions, not faster guesses. The kind that respects applicants, honors donors, and elevates the mission of WAI itself.

The future of scholarship review isn’t about automation.
It’s about amplification.
It’s about clarity.
It’s about fairness at scale.
It’s about ensuring that every young woman who dreams of aviation has her story seen fully, even when it arrives in December.

WAI Co-Pilot is not a tool. It’s a promise — that as WAI grows, fairness grows with it. That as scholarships multiply, excellence does too. That no applicant will ever be lost in the noise. And that every review board, for every scholarship, every year, will have the clarity it needs to choose its next rising star.
